# Rendering
## Turtle renderer
[Maya help: Turtle renderer](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/ENU/123112/files/turtle-html.html)  

Turtle is a sophisticated baking plug-in for Autodesk® Maya® software used for lighting and content creation in next-gen game development.

It is installed with Maya (starting version 2014).

Turtle lets you:

- Create stunning global illumination for game levels.  
- Bake illumination into texture maps, vertex maps, or point clouds.  
- Bake occlusion and normal maps from detailed models to low-polygon models.

## GLTF

Web3D Conference, June 2017](https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/developers/library/2017-web3d/glTF-2.0-Launch_Jun17.pdf)  
- [Blendergltf](https://github.com/Kupoman/blendergltf) 
Blendergltf is an addon for Blender that adds the ability to export to the glTF format. This addon started its life as part of the Blender Real TimeEngine addon in order to provide a convenient way of streaming scene data to real time engines. As interest has grown in glTF, the glTF exporting code of the Blender Real Time Engine addon was moved into this repository to be used as both a Python module and a Blender addon.

## Motion Capture 
### Data collecting / generating
- Download free motion capture data as .fbx

	- [mocapdata.com](http://mocapdata.com/)  
	mocapdata.com provides 933 premium and 4671 free motion datasets and is advertised as 'the world biggest state of the art motion capture library on the earth.'
	- [turbosquid.com](http://www.turbosquid.com/Search/Motion-Capture/free/fbx)  
	 TurboSquid provides 3D assets including 3D models. You can find free 3D models as well as free motion capture FBX data that can be imported to Maya. 

- Create a folder to save the downloaded fbx files.   

### In Maya
- Open the Maya scene where your HIK character. 
- Import fbx data into the scene. Check the imported character from the outliner window, and play to check the animation.  
- In the HIK window, your character should be in the Character box (e.g., Character1) and change the Source to the imported character. (e.g., Humanoid1)
- Now you can see that your character behaves according to the imported MOCAP motion.

### Export to Unreal
- Choose the highest bone of your character, where has kyes. 
- Go to File / Send to Unreal -> Selection and export your animation. 

- You can choose the mesh and skeletons and export them too. 

### In the Unreal Engine
- Opne Epic Games Launcher and Launch Unreal Engine. You need to create your account in the Epic Games, if you don't have.
- Create New Project. 
- In the Content Browser, create one folder and import your fbx files to here.
