	*"A good game artist is a modern-day alchemist, conjuring up not just mere objects from polygons and pixels, but entire worlds."* 
	 
	*"The process of making a video game is much more complex than most people imagine. To someone who has never been involved in the production of a video game, it may seem quite simple. You come up with a good idea, hire some people, and get to work until you are done, right? Of course, it’s not quite that easy. There are always unforeseen issues, missed deadlines, seemingly impossible hurdles, and many long hours."*

# Production workflow
## 3D production pipelines
![production](img/pipeline.png)	 
Reference: [digital] Modeling Chapter 1 Introduction.

### Pre-production
- Decide genre or characteristics. (Art as Game, Game as Art, Indie/notgames etc.)
- Concept art (discussion, brainstorming, story)
- Visual research (color pallete, visual design)
- Planning (flow chart with choices, discussion and analysis of problems)  

### Production
- Modeling (Level of Detail)
	- Landscape
	- Object
	- Character (Anatomy, ...)
- Texturing (Level of Detail, UV texturing, normal map)
- Lighting
- Rigging, Animation, Visual effects

### Post-production	 
- Compositing
- Test
- File management
	- Baking, import, export
- Show case/Demo

## What are game assets?
- [Working in Unity/Asset Workflow](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetWorkflow.html):    
An asset is representation of any item that can be used in your game or project. An asset may come from a file created outside of Unity, such as a 3D model, an audio file, an image, or any of the other types of file that Unity supports.

by Oussama Bouanani, 24 Jul 2015](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-fund-your-games-by-creating-and-selling-game-assets--cms-24380)  
	***What Are Game Assets?*** Game assets include everything that can go into a game, including 3D models, sprites, sound effects, music, code snippets and modules, and even complete projects that can be used by a game engine. Here's a list of examples:  
	- 2D/3D Design: Characters, Objects, Environments, Vehicles  
	- GUI: HUD, Icons  
	- Scripting: AI, Special effects, Networking, Physics  
	- Audio: Background music, Sound effects

# Low Poly  

In the early days of 3D games, the number of polygons was a much more critical issue for the real-time medium. The calculation power of hardware was pretty limited. Each game object should have the lowest number of geometric faces for the game to run smoothly and fast. For example, a character in the original Quake from id Software, published in 1996, was constructed using 200 polygons (many modern games spend more than ten thousand tris). Nowadays, in many cases low poly graphics are no longer so necessary, however in some cases (e.g. for VR) there are still important benefits. Moreover, low poly is an approach to present 3D models in an interesting visual way; a unique visual style with low complexity, hand-made, retro, and other flavours.

## The "Low Poly" Aesthetic

- Small numbers of irregular tris and quads 3D polygon model.  
- Characteristic: No smooth curves (simpler look), hard edges (showing distinctive faces). 
- Stylistic approach over realism, however often it weighs heavily on realistic lighting (often physically based) and on texture details (with large textures).  
- Important features: Polycount matters and (manifold) topology is critical (quads are more intuitive).

## The "Low Poly" Technique
- Create 3D low poly modeling.
- Polygon decimation and optimization for real time applications (Manifold topology)
- Shading and baking textures  
- Texturing and UV mapping 
- Rendering (local vs. global illumination) 
- Export 3D model for game engines
- Level of detail (LoD)
- No visual effects, rigging, animation in this class

## Tools: Maya (2018~2020) and many others:

As a representative 3D computer graphics application, Maya is one of the most widely used to create interactive 3D applications, including video games, animated film, TV series, visual effects, architecture, academic and science research, and more. Through the Maya GUI and programmable extensions, users define a virtual workspace (scenes) to implement and edit media of a particular project. Scene elements are node-based, each node having its own attributes and customization. The output is usually 3D model assets and rendered images.

# 1st deliverable: Planning (30%)
- [1st deliverable (Pre-production](https://canvascloud.ocadu.ca/courses/1293/assignments/20428))  

<!--

Using your traditional art skills including drawing, sketch, painting, sculpture, or photo, create your concept art to suggest subjects and objects for this class. By discussing/voting, we will choose one or some of the group's concept art as the pre-production content to unfold into our ongoing production process, which we will all develop together in collaboration. 
You have the most freedom but the only condition is that you need to prepare to persuade your concept world to your colleagues by your art and your plan. 

- Where to add: [google slide: ConceptArtPresentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Vy3W0ly3vpAFUMIHTy6J8bETTIZNrcERb4C0e4ZMz1I/edit?usp=sharing)
	- Reference from previous class - [google slide: ConceptArtPresentation (2019)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hHNOmsKKMD-k1CPX0Ba4GomcW4zh7lJ2CBV-RS_Pqaw/edit?usp=sharing)

- Presentation length: the amount you can present in lesser than 3 minutes.  

- What to include: 

	- Your name.  
	- Introductory description / your idea.  
	- Visual support such as character/background sketch/paint, color palette, visual research, and so on. 
	
- Please upload your presentation slide as a pdf to Canvas. Please don't upload everybody's slides. -->
