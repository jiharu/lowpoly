## Motion capture
### Motion control 

- Computer animation refers to any computer-based computation used in the production of images intended to create the perception of motion.

-  In general, any value that can be changed can be animated. An object’s position and orientation are obvious candidates for animation, but all the following can be animated as well: the object’s shape, its shading parameters, its texture coordinates, the light source parameters, and the camera parameters.

-  Three general approaches to motion control in 3D computer animation:    
	- ***artistic animation*** - the animator has the prime responsibility for crafting the motion.

	- ***data-driven animation*** - live motion is digitized and then mapped onto graphical objects. The primary technology for data-driven animation is *motion capture* (MoCap).

	- ***procedural animation*** - there is a computational model that is used to control the motion. Usually, this is in the form of setting initial conditions for some type of physical or behavioral simulation.

		Karl Sims is a digital media artist, computer graphics research scientist, and software entrepreneur. He was the founder of GenArts, Inc., a creator of visual effects software for the motion picture industry. He previously held positions at Thinking Machines Corporation, Optomystic, and Whitney/Demos Productions. Karl studied computer graphics at the MIT Media Lab, and Life Sciences as an undergraduate at MIT. He is the recipient of various awards including two ARS Electronica Golden Nicas and a MacArthur Fellowship Award.

## Animation in interactive 3D
When playing a game, the player drives the motion of the scene. Therefore,
animation is stored in small sequences that are controlled using the joystick
(the player's control). For character animation, some systems support inverse
kinematics (IK) and some do not. 	

### Reading: Interactive 3D
- Art of Maya [pdf link](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent/classes/682/MAYA/art_of_maya.pdf) 
	- Interactive 3D. P.81 ~ 85.
 	

## MoCap data: data collecting or generating 
- Download free motion capture data as .fbx

	- [mocapdata.com](http://mocapdata.com/)  
	mocapdata.com provides 933 premium and 4671 free motion datasets and is advertised as 'the world biggest state of the art motion capture library on the earth.'
	- [turbosquid.com](http://www.turbosquid.com/Search/Motion-Capture/free/fbx)  
	 TurboSquid provides 3D assets including 3D models. You can find free 3D models as well as free motion capture FBX data that can be imported to Maya. 

- Create a folder to save the downloaded fbx files.   

### In Maya
- Open the Maya scene where your HIK character. 
- Import fbx data into the scene. Check the imported character from the outliner window, and play to check the animation.  
- In the HIK window, your character should be in the Character box (e.g., Character1) and change the Source to the imported character. (e.g., Humanoid1)
- Now you can see that your character behaves according to the imported MOCAP motion.

### Export to Unreal
- Choose the highest bone of your character, where has kyes. 
- Go to File / Send to Unreal -> Selection and export your animation. 
- You can choose the mesh and skeletons and export them too. 

### In the Unreal Engine
- Opne Epic Games Launcher and Launch Unreal Engine. You need to create your account in the Epic Games, if you don't have.
- Create New Project. 
- In the Content Browser, create one folder and import your fbx files to here.
