## Motion capture
### Motion control 

- Computer animation refers to any computer-based computation used in the production of images intended to create the perception of motion.

-  In general, any value that can be changed can be animated. An object’s position and orientation are obvious candidates for animation, but all the following can be animated as well: the object’s shape, its shading parameters, its texture coordinates, the light source parameters, and the camera parameters.

-  Three general approaches to motion control in 3D computer animation:    
	- ***artistic animation*** - the animator has the prime responsibility for crafting the motion.

	- ***data-driven animation*** - live motion is digitized and then mapped onto graphical objects. The primary technology for data-driven animation is *motion capture* (MoCap).

	- ***procedural animation*** - there is a computational model that is used to control the motion. Usually, this is in the form of setting initial conditions for some type of physical or behavioral simulation.

## Animation in interactive 3D
When playing a game, the player drives the motion of the scene. Therefore,
animation is stored in small sequences that are controlled using the joystick
(the player's control). For character animation, some systems support inverse
kinematics (IK) and some do not. 	

### Reading: Interactive 3D
- Art of Maya [pdf link](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent/classes/682/MAYA/art_of_maya.pdf) 
	- Interactive 3D. P.81 ~ 85.
 	

## MoCap data: data collecting or generating 
- Download free motion capture data as .fbx

	- [mocapdata.com](http://mocapdata.com/)  
	mocapdata.com provides 933 premium and 4671 free motion datasets and is advertised as 'the world biggest state of the art motion capture library on the earth.'
	- [turbosquid.com](http://www.turbosquid.com/Search/Motion-Capture/free/fbx)  
	 TurboSquid provides 3D assets including 3D models. You can find free 3D models as well as free motion capture FBX data that can be imported to Maya. 

- Create a folder to save the downloaded fbx files.   

### In Maya
- Open the Maya scene where your HIK character. 
- Import fbx data into the scene. Check the imported character from the outliner window, and play to check the animation.  
- In the HIK window, your character should be in the Character box (e.g., Character1) and change the Source to the imported character. (e.g., Humanoid1)
- Now you can see that your character behaves according to the imported MOCAP motion.

### Export to Unreal
- Choose the highest bone of your character, where has kyes. 
- Go to File / Send to Unreal -> Selection and export your animation. 
- You can choose the mesh and skeletons and export them too. 

### In the Unreal Engine
- Opne Epic Games Launcher and Launch Unreal Engine. You need to create your account in the Epic Games, if you don't have.
- Create New Project. 
- In the Content Browser, create one folder and import your fbx files to here.

## Physically Based Rendering

Physically based techniques attempt to simulate reality by using principles of physics to model the interaction of light and matter. Rendered scenes are based on physically accurate lights, materials, and light transport (i.e., Global Illumination). 
In physically based rendering, realism is usually the primary goal. There is less tweaking and fewer parameters to get the correct results. However the computational cost usually becomes a lot more expensive and we need to understand physical lighting phenomena.

## Physically Based Rendering in Arnold

Arnold is **a physically based renderer**, but it also lets you break the rules and create materials and lights that do not obey the laws of physics if you wish.  

Designing materials based on physical laws can tremendously simplify shading and lighting, even when we do not necessarily strive for realism or physical accuracy. **By understanding and applying a few principles** we can make images that are more believable, and create materials that behave more predictably in different lighting setups.

This material library is meant as a beginners guide for the type of material effects that are possible when using the Standard Surface shader. Bear in mind that the values used here are not based on any physical, real world values and are meant only as a starting point for beginners to explore. It is embedded as presets for AiStandardSurface material.  

The **Arnold Standard Surface** shader is a physically-based shader capable of producing many types of materials. It includes a diffuse layer, a specular layer with complex Fresnel for metals, specular transmission for glass, subsurface scattering for skin, thin scattering for water and ice, a secondary specular coat, and light emission.

## IBL: Image Based Lighting

[Wikipedia: IBL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image-based_lighting)

Image-based lighting (IBL) is a 3D rendering technique which involves capturing an omnidirectional representation of real-world light information as an image, typically using a specialized camera. This image is then projected onto a dome or sphere analogously to environment mapping, and this is used to simulate the lighting for the objects in the scene. This allows highly detailed real-world lighting to be used to light a scene, instead of trying to accurately model illumination using an existing rendering technique.

Image-based lighting often uses high dynamic range imaging for greater realism, though this is not universal.

### HDRI: High Dynamic Range Image

[Wikipedia: HDRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-dynamic-range_imaging)

High-dynamic-range imaging (HDRI) is a high dynamic range (HDR) technique used in imaging and photography to reproduce a greater dynamic range of luminosity that is possible with standard digital imaging or photographic techniques. The aim is to present a similar range of luminance to that experienced through the human visual system. 

### Comparison with traditional digital images
Information stored in high-dynamic-range images typically corresponds to the physical values of luminance or radiance that can be observed in the real world. This is different from traditional digital images, which represent colors as they should appear on a monitor or a paper print. Therefore, HDR image formats are often called scene-referred, in contrast to traditional digital images, which are device-referred or output-referred. 

HDR images often don't use fixed ranges per color channel—other than traditional images—to represent many more colors over a much wider dynamic range. For that purpose, they don't use integer values to represent the single color channels (e.g., 0-255 in an 8 bit per pixel interval for red, green and blue) but instead use a floating point representation. Common are 16-bit (half precision) or 32-bit floating point numbers to represent HDR pixels.
