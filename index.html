# DIGF-2012-001 Low Poly Game Art
Winter 2020

**Course name:** Low Poly Game Art   
**Meetings:** Wednesday, 8:30pm–11:30pm      
**Location:** Room 510, 205 Richmond St W (RHA)          
**Course webpage:** Canvas & [http://jiharu.github.io/lowpoly/](http://jiharu.github.io/lowpoly/)

## Course description 

Low polygon 3D art occur in real-time applications like digital games that have historically been constrained by the technologies used. However this approach to 3D modelling has become a contemporary art form evidenced across a wide range of contexts from art galleries to game consoles. This studio course surveys a broad range of approaches to building low poly game art exploring 3D production processes and contexts of delivery. Students will produce low poly playable experiences ready for exhibition.

## Additional Information

The ever expanding domains of games and interactive realtime 3D applications are also media of expression, reflection, and criticality. As a first step to creating games and real-time 3D applications for artistic expression, artists should be able to create their own 3D assets: modular libraries including geometric and textured objects. The most  widely-used and approachable surface modeling technique is polygon modeling, building objects as geometric meshes. However for interactive real-time applications, including games, the computational cost demands that these have a low number of polygons, known as "low poly". This constraint has however also become a recognizable aesthetic style, also known as "low poly art", that is often rendered with simplistic modeling & texturing but rich physically-based lighting techniques.

Participants will gain knowledge, experience, and freedom to create, modify, and manage 3D data as assets for realtime, interactive applications and environements including platforms such as WebGL and game engines such as Unity and Unreal. We will choose interdiscplinary approaches working together with both concept and practice, digital artmaking and traditional skills. Among the practical skillsets, participants will work on modeling, texturing (texture cretaion, UV texturing), lighting, Level of Detail (LoD), texture baking, and managing and organising the importing and exporting of data between applications. Each participant will learn how to solve problems in dealing with complex workflows & production pipelines, to express their artistic intentions and to develop their style, and lastly to gain critical and reflective perspectives with regard to game as art, and art as game.

## Technology Tools:
Maya, Unity, Unreal, Blender, Cinema 4D, Sculptris, Rhino, Photoshop, etc.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the pipelines of making interactive real time 3D applications, such as computer games   
- Create assets for real-time applications, notably game engines such as Unity or Unreal  
- Have developed observational and problem solving skills  
- Have developed personal styles and perspectives toward worldmaking  
- Have developed quality standards  
- Show evidence of teamwork experience including communication between team members to produce an integrated art result  
- Use newly integrated skillsets to model, texture, and light 3D assets, including producing LoDs (levels of detail), UV texturing, and texture and light baking, and managing, importing, and exporting assets between independent applications  
- Critically examine the possibility of art as game and game as art, to think beyond mainstream and conventional approaches toward games
