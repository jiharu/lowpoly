## Course description 

Low polygon 3D art occur in real-time applications like digital games that have historically been constrained by the technologies used. However this approach to 3D modelling has become a contemporary art form evidenced across a wide range of contexts from art galleries to game consoles. This studio course surveys a broad range of approaches to building low poly game art exploring 3D production processes and contexts of delivery. Students will produce low poly playable experiences ready for exhibition.

## Supplies
Students will be required to supply laptop, three button mouse, and headphones (to follow web tutorials) in the class. Please also bring a notebook or small sketchbook and pencils to sketch and collect ideas.  

## Teaching & Learning Methods
We will use a variety of learning strategies in this class including project work, discussions, presentations, tutorials, and lectures. 

## Late Work
All late work will be assessed a minimum penalty of 1 % of the work grade per week. Please remember that even with prior permission, no late work will be accepted more than 21 days after the initial due date.

## Participation
Participation will include the following:

- arriving on time and listening to lectures and instruction.   
- being prepared and working during class time.   
- sharing ideas, concepts and creative exploration.   
- sharing conceptual development in progress and information in making with other students.   
- cooperating in group projects.   
- analyzing and offering opinions about work in progress.   
- listening to and being an active participant in critique discussions.
