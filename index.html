**Meetings:** Friday, 3:10pmâ€“6:10pm  
**Location:** Room 425, Annex Building (MCC)     
**Course webpage:** Canvas & [http://jiharu.github.io/lowpoly/](http://jiharu.github.io/lowpoly/)

## Course description 

Low polygon 3D art occur in real-time applications like digital games that have historically been constrained by the technologies used. However this approach to 3D modelling has become a contemporary art form evidenced across a wide range of contexts from art galleries to game consoles. This studio course surveys a broad range of approaches to building low poly game art exploring 3D production processes and contexts of delivery. Students will produce low poly playable experiences ready for exhibition.

## Course schedule
- **Week 1 (Jan 5):** Introduction. Overview and discussion of class outline, focused on how we will approach Low Poly Game Art, and how we will structure the class. Introduction to the class and class members. Preparation for week 2 individual presentations..

- **Week 2 (Jan 12):** Presentation. All students present their specific learning goals and themes for creation. Based on presentation content, we will form groups to work in the next classes. Discussion and preparation for week 3 group presentation. Lecture on case studies.

- **Week 3 (Jan 19):** Group presentation (15%). Each team will present their survey on what to work on, why to choose, and how to make. Discussion and critiques will follow. Working on plans in detail and finishing documentation (10%) to submit.

- **Week 4 (Jan 26):** Game Art studio. Pre-production and project set-up. Group & individual tutorials & lecture.

- **Week 5 (Feb 2):** Game Art studio. Production. Group & individual tutorials & lecture.

- **Week 6 (Feb 9):** Presentation (10%). Present progress. Sharing discoveries to help each other's making. Discussion and critiques.

- **Week 7 (Feb 16):** Game Art studio. Production. Group & individual tutorials & lecture.

- **Study break (Feb 23)**

- **Week 8 (Mar 2):** Game Art studio. Production & post-production. Group & individual tutorials & lecture.

- **Week 9 (Mar 9):** Final group presentation (20%). Each team will present their journey through the making process, artist statement, and final results, with a self-analysis. Discussion and critiques will follow. Finalize documentation and submit it (10%).

- **Week 10 (Mar 16):** Game Art studio. Individual project set-up. Theme can be derived from your group project, or beyond. Applying LOD (level of detail) techniques.  

- **Week 11 (Mar 23):** Game Art studio. Project development, tutorials & lecture.

- **Good Friday(Mar 30)**

- **Week 12 (Apr 6):** Final presentation (15%). Finalize project. Documentation (10%), discussion & critique. Discussion about critique/exhibition format.
