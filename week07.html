# Pipeline: rendering & baking textures
## Turtle renderer
[Maya help: Turtle renderer](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/ENU/123112/files/turtle-html.html)  

Turtle is a sophisticated baking plug-in for Autodesk® Maya® software used for lighting and content creation in next-gen game development.

It is installed with Maya (starting version 2014).

Turtle lets you:

- Create stunning global illumination for game levels.  
- Bake illumination into texture maps, vertex maps, or point clouds.  
- Bake occlusion and normal maps from detailed models to low-polygon models.

## Unreal Engine 4
Unreal Engine 4 is a complete suite of game development tools made by game developers, for game developers. From 2D mobile games to console blockbusters and VR, Unreal Engine 4 gives you everything you need to start, ship, grow and stand out from the crowd.
- description by [Unreal Engine.](https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4)  

The Unreal Engine is a game engine developed by Epic Games, first showcased in the 1998 first-person shooter game Unreal. Although primarily developed for first-person shooters, it has been successfully used in a variety of other genres, including stealth, MMORPGs, and other RPGs. With its code written in C++, the Unreal Engine features a high degree of portability and is a tool used by many game developers today.

The current release is Unreal Engine 4, designed for Microsoft's DirectX 11 and 12 (for Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, Windows RT); OpenGL (for OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4, iOS, Android, Ouya and Windows XP); and JavaScript/WebGL (for HTML5 Web browsers).

## Import modeling & animation assets from Maya

![unreal01](img/lab/unreal.png) 
![unreal02](img/lab/unreal01.png) 

## File format to use: OBJ or FBX
### Obj
OBJ has it’s origins with Alias Wavefront, a simple data-format that represents 3D geometry — namely, the position of each vertex, the UV position of each texture coordinate vertex, vertex normals, and the faces that make each polygon defined as a list of vertices, and texture vertices. 

- [Comparison I between OBJ & FBX](http://aecobjects.com/2014/10/which_format_is_better/)
- [Comparison II between OBJ & FBX](http://www.reallusion.com/iclone/help/3DXchange5/Pipeline/05_Export/The_Comparison_of_OBJ_FBX.htm)

### FBX

FBX is a file format owned and developed by Autodesk. It is used to provide interoperability between digital content creation applications such as Autodesk MotionBuilder, Autodesk Maya, and Autodesk 3ds Max. Autodesk MotionBuilder software supports FBX natively, while Autodesk Maya and Autodesk 3ds Max software include FBX plug-ins.

Unreal Engine features an FBX import pipeline which allows simple transfer of content from any number of digital content creation applications that support the format.

The advantages of the Unreal FBX Importer over other importing methods are:

- Static Mesh, Skeletal Mesh, animation, and morph targets in a single file format.
- Multiple assets/content can be contained in a single file.
- Import of multiple LODs and Morphs/Blendshapes in one import operation.
- Materials and textures imported with and applied to meshes.

- [FBX Content Pipeline in Unreal Engine 4](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Content/FBX/index.html)  

## When you made assets in Maya
- If it is static, you can save it as obj and import to the content browser in Unreal. 
You need to import textures and build the material in the material editor in Unreal. Your object should have UV texture coordinate assigned.  

- If it has rigs and animation, save it as fbx. You still need to import textures separately and your objects should have UV texture coordinate too. 

## FBX exporter in Maya

- You can export as fbx directly. 
- Or you can use the game exporter as below, under File menu:

![exporter](img/lab/exporter.png) 

- In the Unreal UI, you will see this window to import FBX. Check some parameters:

## ART (Maya Animation Rigging Toolset) 

![unreal](img/lab/CharacterSetupImage.jpg)
Image from [Unreal Engine 4 Maya Animation Rigging Toolset](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Content/Tools/MayaRiggingTool/index.html)  

The Animation and Riggings Toolset (ART) is a comprehensive toolset that takes a character through skeleton creation, skeleton placement, and rig creation, as well as many animation tools to speed up your animators' workflow, currently tested and confirmed in Maya 2013 and up. Features include:

- Intuitive user interfaces guide the user through every process.
- Complete skeletal creation.
- Custom skeleton placement via an intuitive positioning rig.
- An entire rig can be published and sent to the animation team in under a minute!
- Ability to provide simple skinning to your final character.
- A full suite of animation tools complete with user interface, including importing mocap or animation data, exporting to FBX, pose tools, mirroring, space switching, and more!

The ART is split into two modes: [Rigging](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Content/Tools/MayaRiggingTool/RigTool_Rigging/index.html) and [Animation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Content/Tools/MayaRiggingTool/index.html), each with their own distinct interfaces. For a character to use the ART Animation interface, it must be produced from the Rigging interface.

*Caution: The ART is tested in Maya 2012-14 in the Window system. If you try other than these set-ups, you need to research and go through trials & errors (and may need to wait for the updates).*

To download the latest ART set:
- [Maya_AnimationRiggingTools](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/e49zvu9btm55o3t/Ietd28dXEJ):
This is mainly developed my Jeremy Ernst, a lead technical animator from Epic Games. You can find the ART sources as well as tutorial videos.

#  WebVR / WebAR and glTF
## WebAR
- [Creating Augmented Reality with AR.js and A-Frame](https://aframe.io/blog/arjs/) by Jerome Etienne.

- [WebVR for Augmented Reality](https://medium.com/arjs/webvr-for-augmented-reality-f1e69a505902)  

## WebVR
- [WebVR](https://webvr.info/) is an open specification that makes it possible to experience VR in your browser. The goal is to make it easier for everyone to get into VR experiences, no matter what device you have.

## glTF
		
- [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/): efficient runtime 3D asset delivery. Portable 3D graphics transmission Format.    
glTF™ (GL Transmission Format) is a royalty-free specification for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and models by applications. glTF minimizes both the size of 3D assets, and the runtime processing needed to unpack and use those assets. glTF defines an extensible, common publishing format for 3D content tools and services that streamlines authoring workflows and enables interoperable use of content across the industry.  
	- Compact to transmit.  
	- Fast to load.  
	- Describes full scenes.   
	- Runtime neutral.  
	- Open and extensible.

- Blendergltf
	- [Blendergltf](https://github.com/Kupoman/blendergltf) is an addon for Blender that adds the ability to export to the glTF format. This addon started its life as part of the Blender Real TimeEngine addon in order to provide a convenient way of streaming scene data to real time engines. As interest has grown in glTF, the glTF exporting code of the Blender Real Time Engine addon was moved into this repository to be used as both a Python module and a Blender addon.
