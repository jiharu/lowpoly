# Week 3

- Sharing collective progress report.  
- Preparing production process.   
- Pre­production: finalizing pre-production. 
- Team discussion.    
- Making: finalizing pre­production process.    
- Assignment: reading + your collective process report.

___________________________________
# Finalizing pre-production

## Collective process report presentation.
Each team gives a process report presentation for sharing ideas and feedback in class.

## What to consider in planning
Reference: Gahan, Andrew, 3ds Max Modeling for Games: Volume II. Focal Press, 2012.

### Schedule and resources
- Ensure that you have enough time and resources to deliver it on time. Always ensure you know the deadline.  

### Computational cost based on your delivery forms
- Determine the polygon count (triangles or quadrangles), texture resolution specifications, and what types of textures are required (Bump, Specular, Normal maps, etc). 

### High quality pre-production preparation
- Visual design / concept art  
	If you don’t have clear and detailed concepts for your project, don’t start modeling. It’s a lot easier to make changes in 2D and on sketches, than it is halfway through your 3D build. A lot of artists fail to do this – don’t fall into the same trap. It’s a worthwhile investment of time to make all your decisions up front.

## 3D modeling 
### Installation Maya
- Check the [week 1](https://jiharu.github.io/lowpoly/week01.html) Maya installation section to find a link to download the educational version of Maya. 

### Action item
If you haven't used Maya yet, please do the tutorial below. This will cover the basics of how to use Maya:  

- [Lynda.com: Maya 2018 essential training](https://www.lynda.com/Maya-tutorials/Maya-2018-Essential-Training/604210-2.html?org=ocadu.ca)

## Maya based low poly tips

![lowpoly](img/lowpolytest01.png)   
by H.Ji. 

- You can find test models from ***Windows/General Editors/Content Browser/***
- Harden edge - Interpolation of vertex normals to make hard edges: ***Mesh Display/Harden Edge***
- Polygon reduction also known as mesh decimation): ***Mesh/Reduce***    
	- [Maya help - reduce](http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2018/ENU//index.html?guid=GUID-49F4731D-4F59-4B98-9751-F0E1CAA675CD)  
- Checking Polygon component numbers - turn on ***Display/Heads Up Display/Poly Count***  
	- [Maya help - poly count ](http://help.autodesk.com/view/MAYAUL/2018/ENU//index.html?guid=GUID-53E46D0C-4B7B-4404-AEB0-3BDD1FF8608A)	
	- **Poly count:** displays polygon statistics for the visible objects displayed in the view panel, including Vertices, Edges, Faces, Triangles, and UVs. This feature is useful for game development. The first column on the left lists the total components of all the polygons in the scene. The second column lists the total components of the selected polygon(s). The third column lists the total selected components. The default is off.    	
- **PBR** renderer: physically based render in Maya is Arnold.
	- [Arnold rendering](https://jiharu.github.io/intm3d/week12.html) - aiSkyDomeLight applying when you want to use **HDRI**.

- Above image: using **ambient occlusion** and adding **bevel** edges.	


# Discussion & group formation

# Assignment detail  
## An (online) journal:
- Keep working on your personal journal whenever you make good progress. 
- Please finalize your collective process online report before next class.   
	- Please add credits to each input text or image.  
	- Please assign to each member modeling tasks according to their previous skill levels and their current interest.  
	- Each member needs to complete their front, side, perspective sketches for their modeling task(s). Please be sensitive to comparable scales. Upload them into the progress report(s) with proper captions.   
	
## Reading: Modeling Theory
Please read ***"Chap. 2. Chapter 2. Modeling Theory"*** from the book: Omernick, Matthew. Creating the Art of the Game. New Riders, 2004, *Online access (Toronto Public Library)*
