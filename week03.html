# Review
- Omernick, Matthew. [Creating the Art of the Game. New Riders, 2004](https://proquestcombo-safaribooksonline-com.ezproxy.torontopubliclibrary.ca/book/animation-and-3d/0735714096), *Online access (Toronto Public Library)*  

	*"A good game artist is a modern-day alchemist, conjuring up not just mere objects from polygons and pixels, but entire worlds."* 
	 
	*"The process of making a video game is much more complex than most people imagine. To someone who has never been involved in the production of a video game, it may seem quite simple. You come up with a good idea, hire some people, and get to work until you are done, right? Of course, it’s not quite that easy. There are always unforeseen issues, missed deadlines, seemingly impossible hurdles, and many long hours."*

# Team formation 
*"I prefer to work with people who are willing to merge ideas and be comfortable with peoples decisions. I'm willing to work with people who get the work done on time and constantly communicate with each other to help or suggest ideas. I don't mind the concept not being my suit as long as people are willing to work hard and motivate others to do the same."*

# Pre-production
It will work as a blueprint to detail and to construct your project.  

- **Blocking out your scene / Greyboxing / Blockout**: start a rough sketch using 3D blocks. Use simple primitive shapes to define scale and layout of your world.   
- Gathering and studying visual references.
- Finalizing your concept art. 

## What to consider in pre-production stage
Reference: Gahan, Andrew, 3ds Max Modeling for Games: Volume II. Focal Press, 2012.

- High quality pre-production preparation
	- Visual design / concept art  
	If you don’t have clear and detailed concepts for your project, don’t start modeling. It’s a lot easier to make changes in 2D and on sketches, than it is halfway through your 3D build. A lot of artists fail to do this – don’t fall into the same trap. It’s a worthwhile investment of time to make all your decisions up front.  

- Schedule and resources
	- Ensure that you have enough time and resources to deliver it on time. Always ensure you know the deadline.  

- Computational cost based on your delivery forms
	- Determine **the polygon count** (triangles or quadrangles), **texture resolution specifications**, and **what types of textures** are required (Bump, Specular, Normal maps, etc).

# Collective process report 
- What to include:
	- Title & a simple subject description.  
	- Names of team members and their roles in the production. 
		- Everyone needs to take at least one role as a lead of different parts in the production pipeline.  
	- Genre & style, how to express.    
	- Visual references & color palette. 
	- Your world layout/blueprint/floorplan & list of objects to make. 
	- Objects/characters/landscape design sketches (top, front, side views)  
	- The chosen applications & techniques to use or to learn them.  
	- A brief description of your team's strengths and weaknesses.  
	
- Each team will give a process report presentation for sharing ideas and feedback in class.  
- As you progress, list challenges and share how you solved them. A simple tutorial style is encouraged.   	
	
## Inspiration

![inspiration](http://www.skawennati.com/SheFallsForAges/graphs/BecomingSkyWoman.png)  

- [She falls for ages](http://www.skawennati.com/SheFallsForAges/)    
	
	**A machinima by Skawennati.**  
	
	This sci-fi retelling of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) creation story reimagines Sky World as a futuristic, utopic space and Sky Woman as a brave astronaut and world-builder. It begins on an ancient, alien world whose culture centres on the care and reverence for the beautiful, energy-producing Celestial Tree. The central figure of the tale is Otsitsakaion, a telepath. When she learns that her world is dying, she knows what must be done; she must become the seed of the new world. Using the new media technique known as machinima, She Falls For Ages boldly mixes Haudenosaunee storytelling with science fiction to connect the deep past and the far future.  
	
	In creating this work, I used a new media technique known as "machinima"—making movies in virtual environments. Along with my team at Aboriginal Territories in Cyberpace, we built virtual sets, customized avatars and choreographed action in the massively multiplayer online 3D world Second Life. - Skawennati, [Leonardo Volume 51, Number 4, 2018, The MIT Press](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/702029)

Film Screening: David Cronenberg’s eXistenZ (1999)
Wednesday, April 22 at 6:30 p.m.
Set in the near-future, eXistenZ depicts a society in which game designers are worshipped as superstars and players can organically enter inside the games. At the centre of the story is Allegra Geller whose latest games system eXistenZ taps so deeply into its users’ fears and desires that it blurs the boundaries between reality and escapism.

- How to use the Modeling Toolkit:
	- Using symmetry constraints.  
	- How to extrude. 
	- How to add edges.

# Discussion & group formation

# Assignment detail  
## Working on pre-production
## Two (online) journals:
- Keep working on your personal journal whenever you make good progress. 
- Please finalize your collective process online report before next class.   
	- Don't forget to add credits to each input text or image.  
	- When you assign modeling tasks to each member, please consider their previous skill levels and their current interests.    
	- Each member needs to complete their front, side, perspective sketches for their modeling task(s). Please be sensitive to comparable scales between each model. Upload them into the progress report(s) with proper captions.   
	
## Collective report presentation preparation	
## Reading: Modeling Theory
Please read ***"Chap. 2. Chapter 2. Modeling Theory"*** from the book: Omernick, Matthew. [Creating the Art of the Game. New Riders, 2004](https://proquestcombo-safaribooksonline-com.ezproxy.torontopubliclibrary.ca/book/animation-and-3d/0735714096), *Online access (Toronto Public Library)*
