# Week 3

- Sharing collective progress report.  
- Preparing production process.   
- Pre­production: finalizing pre-production. 
- Team discussion.    
- Making: finalizing pre­production process.    
- Assignment: reading + your collective process report.

___________________________________
# Finalizing pre-production

## Collective process report presentation.
Each team gives a process report presentation for sharing ideas and feedback in class.

## What to consider in planning
Reference: Gahan, Andrew, 3ds Max Modeling for Games: Volume II. Focal Press, 2012.

### Schedule and resources
- Ensure that you have enough time and resources to deliver it on time. Always ensure you know the deadline.  

### Computational cost based on your delivery forms
- Determine the polygon count (triangles or quadrangles), texture resolution specifications, and what types of textures are required (Bump, Specular, Normal maps, etc). 

### High quality pre-production preparation
- Visual design / concept art  
	If you don’t have clear and detailed concepts for your project, don’t start modeling. It’s a lot easier to make changes in 2D and on sketches, than it is halfway through your 3D build. A lot of artists fail to do this – don’t fall into the same trap. It’s a worthwhile investment of time to make all your decisions up front.

## 3D modeling 
### Installation Maya
- Check the [week 1](https://jiharu.github.io/lowpoly/week01.html) Maya installation section to find a link to download the educational version of Maya.

# Discussion & group formation

# Assignment detail  
## An (online) journal:
- Keep working on your personal journal whenever you make good progress. 
- Please finalize your collective process online report before next class.   
	- Please add credits to each input text or image.  
	- Please assign to each member modeling tasks according to their previous skill levels and their current interest.  
	- Each member needs to complete their front, side, perspective sketches for their modeling task(s). Please be sensitive to comparable scales. Upload them into the progress report(s) with proper captions.   
	
## Reading: Modeling Theory
Please read ***"Chap. 2. Chapter 2. Modeling Theory"*** from the book: Omernick, Matthew. Creating the Art of the Game. New Riders, 2004, *Online access (Toronto Public Library)*
