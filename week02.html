# An (online) journal:

# Reading: Pre-production
Please read ***"Chap. 1. Preparing to create" p.3~p.14*** from the book: Omernick, Matthew. Creating the Art of the Game. New Riders, 2004, *Online access (Toronto Public Library)*

"Starting a project on the right foot by collecting quality reference, conceptualizing your work, and setting a high standard for yourself will enable you to work efficiently and with focus. Get into the habit of working in broad strokes. Establish a canvas, and add detail as you progress. A successful preproduction process will get the ball rolling in the right direction." *- Excerpts from the book.*

# Team formation
Teams will be announced next week. Meanwhile, I encourage you to review applications or resources you would like to suggest to your team members at the next meeting.
