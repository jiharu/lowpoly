## Unreal Engine 4
Unreal Engine 4 is a complete suite of game development tools made by game developers, for game developers. From 2D mobile games to console blockbusters and VR, Unreal Engine 4 gives you everything you need to start, ship, grow and stand out from the crowd.
- description by [Unreal Engine.](https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4)  

The Unreal Engine is a game engine developed by Epic Games, first showcased in the 1998 first-person shooter game Unreal. Although primarily developed for first-person shooters, it has been successfully used in a variety of other genres, including stealth, MMORPGs, and other RPGs. With its code written in C++, the Unreal Engine features a high degree of portability and is a tool used by many game developers today.

The current release is Unreal Engine 4, designed for Microsoft's DirectX 11 and 12 (for Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, Windows RT); OpenGL (for OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4, iOS, Android, Ouya and Windows XP); and JavaScript/WebGL (for HTML5 Web browsers).

## Turtle renderer
[Maya help: Turtle renderer](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/ENU/123112/files/turtle-html.html)  

Turtle is a sophisticated baking plug-in for Autodesk® Maya® software used for lighting and content creation in next-gen game development.

It is installed with Maya (starting version 2014).

Turtle lets you:

- Create stunning global illumination for game levels.  
- Bake illumination into texture maps, vertex maps, or point clouds.  
- Bake occlusion and normal maps from detailed models to low-polygon models.
